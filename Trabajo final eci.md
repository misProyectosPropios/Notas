(* Instructions: there are 10 exercises. Succesfully completing x exercises will earn you a grade of x. (No partial credit will be given.) Please alter the following comment to tell me which exercises you completed below.*)

(* I completed 3 exercises: Exercise 1, 3, 4.*)

(* Exercise 1 *)

Theorem comp_app { P Q R : UU } (f : P → Q) (g : Q → R) (p : P) : R.
Proof.
apply g.
apply f.
exact p.
Defined.

(* Exercise 2 *)

Lemma path_combination {A : UU} {a a' b : A} (p : a = b) (q: a' = b) : a = a'.
(* Another way to combine paths. *)
Proof.
induction p.
induction q.
apply idpath.
Defined.

(* Exercise 3 *)

Lemma path_combination_fact {A : UU} {a b : A} (p : a = b) : idpath a = path_combination p p.
(* Check that the above way of combining paths does the `right thing'. *)
Proof.
induction p.
simpl.
apply idpath.
Defined.

(* Exercise 4 *)

Definition mult : nat → nat → nat.
Proof.
  intro n.
  intro m.
  induction m.
  - exact 0.
  - exact (add n IHm).
Defined.


(*
Theorem exp : nat → nat → nat.
Proof.
intro n.
induction n.
- exact (λ x , ).
- intro m.
  exact (mult m (IHn m)).
Defined.

*)

Theorem exp : nat → nat → nat.
Proof.
intro n.
intro m.
induction m.
- exact 1.
- exact (mult n IHm).
Defined.

Compute (exp 5 1).

Compute (exp 3 2).

(* Exercise 5 *)

Theorem curried_proj {P Q R : UU} : (P → (Q × R)) → (P → Q).
Proof.
intro pqr.
intro p.
induction pqr.
- exact pr1.
- exact p. 
Defined.

(* Exercise 6 *)

Search (∏ X Y : UU, ∏ f : X → Y, ∏ x y : X, x = y → (f x) = (f y)).

(* This command searches the library for functions of this kind. You should see in the output that ~maponpaths~ is of this kind. You can then print ~maponpaths~ (i.e. write "Print maponpaths.") to see the definition.

You can use this to find other lemmas from the library. You can use any facts without proof from the library about addition and multiplication as well as ~maponpaths~.*)

Theorem exp_hom {l m n : nat} : exp l (m + n) = (exp l m) * (exp l n).
(* `exp l` takes addition to multiplication.*)

Proof.
induction m.
- simpl.
  apply idpath.
- simpl.
  rewrite IHm.
  simpl.
  
  (* Use a lemma that says that the multiplication is conmutative*)
Admitted.

(* Exercise 7 *)

(* isaprop is defined differently in UniMath than we defined in lectures. Show that these two definitions are the the same. *)

(* Note that this is the hardest exercise, but the ones following depend on it. Feel free to leave it admitted and use the result without proof in the following exercises. *)

Theorem prop_thm {P : UU} : isaprop P <-> (∏ x y : P, x = y).
(* The different definitions of isaprop are logically equivalent. *)
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Exercise 8 *)

(* Show that the dependent product type former commutes with `isaprop`.*)

Theorem prop_commutes_Π {A : UU} {B : A → UU} (p : ∏ x : A, isaprop (B x)) : isaprop (∏ x : A, (B x)).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Exercise 9 *)

(* Show that isweq f is a proposition. *)

(* Use ~isapropisofhlevel~ from the library. *)

Theorem isweq_is_prop {A B : UU} (f : A → B) : isaprop (isweq f).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Exercise 10 *)

(* You are allowed to use isweq_iso from the library in this proof: it says if f is a quasiequivalence, then f is an equivalence in that sense.*)

Theorem prop_equiv_to_log_equiv (P Q : hProp) : (P ≃ Q) <-> (P <-> Q).
(* An equivalence between propositions is (logically equivalent to) a logical equivalence. *)
Proof.
Admitted.
